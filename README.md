# Objectives. 
To understand and quantify the degree to which PCP availability mediates the relationship between rurality and life expectancy. 

# Methods. 
We performed a mediation analysis on a longitudinal panel dataset, which included county level estimates (N = 3,104) for the years 2010, 2015, and 2017, with age-adjusted life expectancy as the outcome variable, urbanity as the key independent variable, and PCP density as the mediating variable. County level socio-demographic and healthcare data were included as covariates.

# Results. 
Increasing PCP density in rural counties with primary care shortage to the threshold of being a non-shortage county (>1 physician/3,500 population), as defined by the Health Resources and Services Administration, would be expected to increase mean life expectancy in the county by 65.6 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 31.8, 138.1), while increasing PCP density to the standards recommended by a Secretarial Negotiated Rulemaking Committee (>1 physician/1,500 population) would be expected to increase life expectancy by 186.9 days (IQR: 119.2, 249.8). Increasing PCP density of a rural county from the 25th percentile to the rural median would increase mean life expectancy by 101.4 days (IQR: 88.0, 219.5) and increasing PCP density from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile among rural counties would increase life expectancy in the county by a median of 253.5 days (IQR: 182.9, 269.2). Increasing rural PCP density from the 25th percentile to the urban county median would increase life expectancy by 218.4 days (IQR: 171.5, 251.4).

# Conclusions. 
PCP density mediates the relationship between rurality and  low rural life expectancy. Increasing PCP density in rural counties that are the most acute primary care physician shortage areas, to the rural county median, may be investigated as a strategy to increase rural life expectancy.
